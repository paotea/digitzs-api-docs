description: "Understanding HTTP status codes and error responses from the Digitzs API"
---

## Overview

The Digitzs API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests. When an error occurs, the API returns a status code that helps you understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

<Info>
  Status codes follow the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFCs) standards.
</Info>

## Status Code Categories

HTTP status codes are organized into five categories based on the first digit:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="1xx - Informational" icon="circle-info">
    The request was received, continuing process
  </Card>
  <Card title="2xx - Successful" icon="circle-check">
    The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
  </Card>
  <Card title="3xx - Redirection" icon="arrows-turn-right">
    Further action is necessary to complete the request
  </Card>
  <Card title="4xx - Client Error" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
  </Card>
  <Card title="5xx - Server Error" icon="server">
    The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## HTTP Status Codes

### Success Codes (2xx)

<ResponseField name="200 - OK" type="Success">
  The request was successful and the server returned the requested data.

  **When you'll see it:**
  - Successfully retrieving merchant data
  - Successfully retrieving payment information
  - Successfully listing resources

  ```json
  {
    "links": {
      "self": "https://api.digitzs.com/merchants"
    },
    "data": {
      "type": "merchants",
      "id": "merchant-123",
      "attributes": { ... }
    }
  }
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="201 - Created" type="Success">
  The request was successful and a new resource was created.

  **When you'll see it:**
  - Creating a new merchant account
  - Processing a new payment
  - Generating authentication tokens

  ```json
  {
    "links": {
      "self": "https://api.digitzs.com/payments"
    },
    "data": {
      "type": "payments",
      "id": "payment-456",
      "attributes": { ... }
    }
  }
  ```
</ResponseField>

### Client Error Codes (4xx)

<ResponseField name="400 - Bad Request" type="Error">
  The server cannot process the request due to invalid syntax or missing required parameters.

  **Common causes:**
  - Missing required fields in request body
  - Invalid data format (e.g., non-numeric amount)
  - Malformed JSON
  - Invalid parameter values

  **How to fix:**
  - Verify all required fields are included
  - Check data types match the API specification
  - Validate JSON syntax
  - Review the error message for specific field issues

  ```json
  {
    "errors": [{
      "status": "400",
      "title": "Bad Request",
      "detail": "The amount field is required"
    }]
  }
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="401 - Unauthorized" type="Error">
  Authentication is required or has failed. The request lacks valid authentication credentials.

  **Common causes:**
  - Missing Authorization header
  - Expired app token (tokens expire after 1 hour)
  - Invalid or malformed token
  - Missing x-api-key header

  **How to fix:**
  - Generate a new app token using `/auth/token`
  - Ensure Authorization header format is `Bearer {token}` with capital "B"
  - Verify your API key is correct
  - Include all required authentication headers

  ```json
  {
    "errors": [{
      "status": "401",
      "title": "Unauthorized",
      "detail": "An authorization header is required"
    }]
  }
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="402 - Payment Required" type="Error">
  Reserved for future use. This status code is not currently used by the Digitzs API.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="403 - Forbidden" type="Error">
  The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.

  **Common causes:**
  - Account is not authorized to access the resource
  - API key has been revoked or suspended
  - Insufficient permissions for the requested operation
  - Attempting to access another merchant's data

  **How to fix:**
  - Contact Digitzs support to verify account status
  - Check that you're accessing resources you own
  - Verify your account permissions

  ```json
  {
    "errors": [{
      "status": "403",
      "title": "Forbidden",
      "detail": "The account is not authorized"
    }]
  }
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="404 - Not Found" type="Error">
  The requested resource could not be found on the server.

  **Common causes:**
  - Invalid resource ID (merchant ID, payment ID, etc.)
  - Resource has been deleted
  - Incorrect API endpoint URL
  - Typo in the request path

  **How to fix:**
  - Verify the resource ID exists and is correct
  - Check the endpoint URL for typos
  - Ensure you're using the correct HTTP method
  - Confirm the resource hasn't been deleted

  ```json
  {
    "errors": [{
      "status": "404",
      "title": "Not Found",
      "detail": "The resource cannot be found"
    }]
  }
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="408 - Request Timeout" type="Error">
  The server timed out waiting for the request.

  **Common causes:**
  - Slow network connection
  - Large request payload
  - Server processing delays

  **How to fix:**
  - Retry the request
  - Check your network connection
  - Reduce request payload size if possible
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

  ```json
  {
    "errors": [{
      "status": "408",
      "title": "Request Timeout",
      "detail": "The server timed out"
    }]
  }
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="409 - Conflict" type="Error">
  The request conflicts with the current state of the server.

  **Common causes:**
  - Attempting to create a duplicate resource
  - Race condition with concurrent requests
  - Editing conflict with another user's changes

  **How to fix:**
  - Check if the resource already exists
  - Implement optimistic locking if handling concurrent updates
  - Retry the request with updated data

  ```json
  {
    "errors": [{
      "status": "409",
      "title": "Conflict",
      "detail": "There is an editing conflict"
    }]
  }
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="429 - Too Many Requests" type="Error">
  The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (rate limiting).

  **Common causes:**
  - Exceeding API rate limits
  - Making too many requests in a short time period
  - Not implementing proper request throttling

  **How to fix:**
  - Implement exponential backoff
  - Add delays between requests
  - Cache responses when possible
  - Contact support if you need higher rate limits

  ```json
  {
    "errors": [{
      "status": "429",
      "title": "Too Many Requests",
      "detail": "The user has sent too many requests"
    }]
  }
  ```
</ResponseField>

### Server Error Codes (5xx)

<ResponseField name="500 - Internal Server Error" type="Error">
  The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

  **Common causes:**

      "status": "500",
      "title": "Internal Server Error",
      "detail": "There was an unexpected error"
    }]
  }
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="501 - Not Implemented" type="Error">
  The server does not recognize the request method or lacks the ability to fulfill it.

  **Common causes:**

        "pointer": "/data/attributes/transaction/amount"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Object Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | string | HTTP status code as a string |
| `title` | string | Short, human-readable summary of the error |
| `detail` | string | Detailed explanation of the specific error |
| `source` | object | Optional pointer to the source of the error in the request |

### Example Error Handling

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js

  } catch (error) {
    if (error.response) {
      const status = error.response.status;
      const errorData = error.response.data;

      // Handle specific error codes
      switch (status) {
        case 401:
          console.error('Authentication failed. Refreshing token...');
          // Refresh token and retry
          break;

        case 404:
          console.error('Resource not found:', errorData.errors[0].detail);
          throw new Error('Resource not found');

        case 429:
          console.error('Rate limit exceeded. Retrying after delay...');
          await delay(5000);
