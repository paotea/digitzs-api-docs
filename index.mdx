## Merchant Services

Your users can open a merchant account in real time—without ever leaving your site—and process transactions immediately. You earn revenue on every sale.

**No Abandonment**
Account creation, payment processing, and transaction reporting all happen inside your app. Better UX = Higher Conversions

**No Waiting**
Accounts are created in real-time and merchants can accept payments immediately. No more waiting around for approvals.

**No Receivables**
Automatically split the proceeds from any sale to collect your platform or marketplace fees. No more invoicing. Get your piece of the pie today.

**No Nonsense**
Merchants pay a flat rate of 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction. No surprise fees. No gimmicks. Predictable costs make life easier.

**Instant Funding**
Merchants can get funds instantly when a customer pays with a qualified debit card. Restrictions apply. Reserves required.

**Lifetime revenue**
Payments are now a profit center. Earn income every time a transaction is processed. Making money while you sleep is always nice.

## Headers

As a part of authentication into the Digitzs API, there are different headers that are required to successfully call functions. They are as listed below.

**x-api-key**
This is your API Key, provided during on-boarding

**Authorization**
This is your app token, generated by calling /auth/token (as described below). This token expires every hour.
**NOTE:** the value needs `Bearer` prepended to your app token. This is with a capital "B" and a space between Bearer and your token.

**appId**
This is your application ID, provided during on-boarding.

## Errors

Status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. They include codes from [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://www.ietf.org/) (IETF) Request for Comments (RFCs), other specifications, and some additional codes used in some common applications of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

There are five status code categories. The first digit of the status code defines the class of response. The last two digits do not have any class or categorization role.

1 – Informational. The request was received, continuing process.

2 – Successful. The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

3 – Redirection. There is further action necessary in order to complete the request.

4 – Client Error. The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.

5 – Server Error. The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
